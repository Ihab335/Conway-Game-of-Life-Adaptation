# Adaptation of Conway's Game of Life Simulation  

This project is an extension of **Conway's Game of Life**, developed as part of a computer science coursework assignment. The original **Game of Life**, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician **John Conway**, simulates simple life forms on a grid, evolving based on predefined rules.  

## Project Overview  

For this coursework, we expanded upon the classic Game of Life by:  

- Introducing **new rules** for cell survival, birth, and death.  
- Adding **unique life forms**, each with distinct behaviors and survival strategies.  
- Implementing **dynamic interactions** between life forms, creating emergent gameplay and unpredictable patterns.  

The goal was to explore how modifying the fundamental rules and adding complexity could generate **new dynamics** within the simulation.  

## Key Features  

- **Enhanced Ruleset:** Expanded survival mechanics introduce greater variation and unpredictability.  
- **New Life Forms:** Unique entities such as **viruses** and **chameleons**, each with specialized behaviors.  
- **Interactive Ecosystem:** Life forms interact in **creative** and **unexpected** ways, making the simulation more engaging and dynamic.  

## Coursework Information  
- **Course:** Year 1 - Computer Science Coursework 3  
- **Objective:** Extend and enhance Conway's Game of Life
