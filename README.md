Adaptation of Conway's Game of Life Simulation
This project is an extension of Conway's Game of Life, developed as part of a coursework assignment. The original Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway, simulates simple life forms on a grid based on a set of rules that determine how cells evolve over time.

Project Overview As part of this coursework, we were tasked with updating the classic Game of Life by:

Introducing new rules for cell survival, birth, and death. Adding new life forms, each with unique characteristics and behaviors. Implementing fun and creative ways for life forms to survive and interact with each other. The aim was to explore how modifying the rules and adding complexity can create new dynamics within the simulation.

Features Updated Rules: We've expanded the traditional survival rules to allow for more varied and unpredictable patterns. New Life Forms: Various types of life forms have been introduced, each with its own survival strategies(e.g virus and chameleon). Interactions: Life forms now interact with each other in creative ways, making the simulation more dynamic and engaging.
